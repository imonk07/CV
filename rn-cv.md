Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the position of React Native Developer at your company. With a solid background in developing applications using React Native and over 3-5 years of experience in the field, I am confident that I possess the skills and expertise necessary to contribute to your team and deliver high-quality software.

I have gained valuable experience during my time at Aeris Communication as an SDE Intern, where I built a React.js web application for financial stability and designed and implemented a dashboard using React.js, Docker, Redis, Apache Maven, Cmder, and TypeScript. Additionally, my internship at Wildwolf.io allowed me to create a multi-platform educational app that teaches financial concepts through a multiplayer game and handle the infrastructure through Firebase Cloud Functions to manage millions of deliveries.

Furthermore, as a Technical Advisor at Creed, I guided and mentored the core technical team, and at TravelBaits, I developed a cross-platform application in React Native and Expo CLI integrating Woocommerce API and custom REST API.

One of my notable projects is "Contango Board Game," a cross-platform educational application built using React Native, Expo CLI, Firebase, Firestore, and Firebase Cloud Functions. This app provides real-time analytics, synchronization of progress with other players, and imparts financial knowledge through a multiplayer game.

In addition to my practical experience, I hold a Bachelor of Technology degree in Information Technology from JSS Academy of Technical Education.

My technical skills include proficiency in JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C++, SQL, React.js, React Native, Redux-Reducer, HTML/CSS, REST APIs, GraphQL, Firebase, Git, AWS, GCP, Docker, and LaTeX.

I am excited about the opportunity to join your team and contribute to the development of responsive, secure, and scalable applications. I am confident in my ability to work collaboratively with other developers, product managers, and stakeholders to deliver high-quality software within time and budget constraints.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my skills and experience align with your requirements. Please find my contact information below, and I am available for an interview at your convenience.

Sincerely,

Mayank Kumar
